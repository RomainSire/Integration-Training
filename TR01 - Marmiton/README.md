# TR01 Marmiton - Description :
I integrated the mainpage of the french cooking website Marmiton (https://www.marmiton.org/). Just to train and improve my skills.

My goal is just to train, not to build an exact copy. As a consequence, for example, I'll use Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/start) for the icons, and Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts.

Also, I used only HTML and CSS on this project, so some javascript effects are missing : especially for the header.
And also, there is no backend obviously.
