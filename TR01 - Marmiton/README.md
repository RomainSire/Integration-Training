# WORK IN PROGRESS !
I'm just getting started on this project, so it's nowhere near finished yet!

## TR01 Marmiton - Description :
I started to integrate the french cooking website Marmiton (https://www.marmiton.org/). Just to train and improve my skills.

My goal is just to train, not to build an exact copy. As a consequence, for example, I'll use Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/start) for the icons, and Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts.

Also, I'll use only HTML and CSS on this project, so some javascript effects will be missing (like the nav toggle), and also no backend obviously.
